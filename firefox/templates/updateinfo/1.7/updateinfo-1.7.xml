<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.7</p>
Add support for firefox 5.0.
Performance improvements for the monitor.
Added rendering options to control position of the 'click to dial' icon.
Fixed a bug where click the 'click to dial' link would cause a page to open.
Changed the 'Enabled' option to 'Show Click Icons' as the term 'Enabled' suggested that Noojee Click can't dial when it is diabled.
In fact you can always 'select' an phone number and then right click to dial it.
The context menu will no longer display the 'Dial Selection' and 'add dial pattern' menu options unless the selected text contains a number.
Worked on the issue when attempting to hangup a call resulting in an error 'channel is null'. 
After an asterisk upgrade I can no longer reproduce this issue.
