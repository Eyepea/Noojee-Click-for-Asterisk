<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.5.4 is primarily a check point for the development team.
As part of the 1.5.4 release we have re-worked the build environment to automate the creation of the xpi files. We have also added the ability to create custom version for clients.
A key area of the automated build process was to get the upgrade process working properly by creating the correct upgrade files with the correct version numbers. This had been a bit of a re-occuring problem which we should now have finally fixed.

There have also been a number of minor bugs fixed in this release.
If you have feature requests or installation/configuration problems post them at http://forums.noojee.com.au</p>
