<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.9.1</p>
Added support for firefox 1,000,000.x. as we are expecting it to be released any day now.

Fixed a problem where on shutdown of firefox NJ Click would pop a dialog say 'Unable to connect to Asterisk'.

Removed the Monitor option as it can seriously degrade firefox's performance. Its a same mozilla won't do their and fix the problem.

<p>If you have feature requests or installation/configuration problems post them at http://forums.noojee.com.au</p>
