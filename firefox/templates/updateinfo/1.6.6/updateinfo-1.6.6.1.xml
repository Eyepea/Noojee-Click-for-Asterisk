<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.6.6.1</p>
Some serious performance improvements for the monitor. It will now only monitor the active page instead of every open page.
This should make a big difference for user that open lots of tabs. Oddly this never really seemed to be a problem under 3.x but under
4.x (which is meant to be faster) it was causing major hangs.
Fixed a bug in the render engine that was causing Firefox 4.0 to hang all too frequently.
Removed the use of a noojeeClicTop span as this wasn't actually necessary.
Tested for regression in Firefox 3.x and 4.0 - all good.
Tweaked the rendering of the noojee click button so that it bottom aligns its self and so that its background was transparent (rather than white).
Modified the Aastra auto-answer header based on feedback from users.

We have now dropped support for Firefox 2.x
