<p>Version 1.6.1 moves the asterisk password into a secure storage area.

When the extension first runs it will copy any existing password
from the preferences to the secure store.

Fixed the extremely annoying problem where when in an html editor Noojee Click
would add click to dial icons. The icons would then be saved permanently by the editor.
Noojee click now detects an editor and excludes the edited content from consideration.

1.6.1 also includes some experimental work on getting Noojee Click to work with Thunderbird :D
