<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.9.8</p>
Added 'wait' event triggers to every dial sequence in order to get over the problem where we can't hangup and the connection status
fails to update.
As far as I can see the fail to hangup is caused by the wait events stopping. The logic of this change is to always restart waitevents.
