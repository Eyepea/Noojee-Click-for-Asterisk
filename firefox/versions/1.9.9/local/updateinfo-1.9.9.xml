<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.9.9</p>
Added 'wait' event triggers to every dial sequence in order to get over the problem where we can't hangup and the connection status
fails to update.
This was meant to have been done in 1.9.8 but somewhere in the process it appears some code was lost (or maybe that was just me) :<
