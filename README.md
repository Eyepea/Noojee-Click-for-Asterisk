Noojee-Click-for-Asterisk
=========================

Provides 'Click to Dial' for Asterisk from your favourite browser.

Noojee Click for Asterisk is a free Firefox extension which turns phone numbers on EVERY web page into 'Click to Dial' links.

Noojee Click scans web pages for phone numbers as the page loads. Phone numbers are identified using a set of configurable Patterns. Each time a phone number is identified Noojee Click adds a Noojee Click 'Dial icon' noojeeclick_tiny.png straight after the phone number. You can dial a number just by clicking on the Dial Icon.

Call progress is displayed in the Firefox Add-on bar and you can hangup the call by clicking the Noojee Click Hangup icon which appears in the Add-on bar during calls or simply by hanging up the phone.
